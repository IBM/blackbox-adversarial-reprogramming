# Black-box-Adversarial-Reprogramming
code for reproducing the ICML 2020 paper "Transfer Learning without Knowing: Reprogramming Black-box Machine Learning Models with Scarce Data and Limited Resources" https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08714 synced with https://github.com/yunyuntsai/Black-box-Adversarial-Reprogramming

Our code is implemented in Python 3.6 and Tensorflow 1.14. 

The following figure illustrates the framework for our proposed black-box adversarial reprogramming method (BAR): <br/>

1. Generate adversarial program. <br/>

2. Find _q_ pertubed adversarial programs with vectors that are uniformly drawn at random
from a unit Euclidean sphere. <br/>

3. Estimate gradient with zeroth-order gradient estimator. The corresponding algorithmic convergence guarantees have been proved in both the convex loss and non-convex loss settings [(Liu et al., 2018; 2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10367.pdf).<br/> 

4. Optimize adversarial programâ€™s parameters _W_. <br/>
